* Enables drawing on the grid by changing the background color of each square on mouse hover.
* Generates random colors for a more dynamic drawing experience.
* Offers a "Reset Grid" button to adjust the grid size.
* Provides a "Clear Grid" button to clear all drawings and start fresh.
* Displays the current grid size in the footer.
* Updates the current year in the footer.

* index.html: This file contains the main HTML structure for the Etch-a-Sketch.
* style.css: This file defines the styles (colors, borders, etc.) for the grid, buttons, and other elements.
* script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that implements the core functionality of the Etch-a-Sketch.
